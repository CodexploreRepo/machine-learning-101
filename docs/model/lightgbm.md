# Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM)

## Introduction

- Light GBM is a high-performance gradient boosting framework for efficient tree-based machine learning, employing a leaf-wise growth strategy and histogram-based learning, ideal for large datasets and tasks where speed is paramount.
- Key Characteristics:
  - Gradient Boosting: It is an ensemble learning method that builds a series of weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong learner.
  - Leaf-Wise Growth: Light GBM grows trees leaf-wise instead of level-wise, leading to faster training times.
  - Histogram-Based Learning: Utilizes histograms to find the best splits during tree growth, reducing memory usage and improving computational efficiency.

## Code Usage

```Python
lgb_model = LGBMClassifier()
lgb_model.fit(X_train_pre,
            y_train,
            eval_metric='auc',
            eval_set=[(X_val_pre, y_val)])
```

## Hyper-parameter Space

- `num_boost_round` (`n_estimators`) number of trees
  - The more trees you have, the more stable your predictions will be
  - **Tip**: Start small, around 100–500, and use early stopping to avoid overfitting.
  - How many trees should you choose:
    - If your model needs to deliver results with low latency, you might want to limit the number of trees to around 200.
    - If your model runs once a week (e.g.: sales forecasting) and has more time to make the predictions, you could consider using up to 5,000 trees
- `learning_rate` controls how much each tree contributes to the final prediction.
  - Rule of thumb: start by fixing the number of trees and then focus on tuning the learning_rate
  - **Tip**: Start with 0.1, then reduce to 0.01 or 0.001 for tougher problems.
  - The more trees you have, the smaller the learning rate should be.
  - Range: 0.001 and 0.1 (`trial.suggest_float("learning_rate", 1e-3, 0.1, log=True)`)
- `num_leaves` maximum number of terminal nodes (leaves) that can be present in each tree.
  - **Tip**: A larger number improves accuracy but can lead to overfitting. Keep it close to `2^(max_depth)`.
  - In a decision tree, a leaf represents a decision or an outcome.
  - Range: powers of 2, starting from 2 and going up to 1024
  - Pros: By increasing the num_leaves, you allow the tree to grow more complex, creating a higher number of distinct decision paths.
  - Cons: increasing the number of leaves may also cause the model to **overfit** the training data, as it will have a lower amount of data per leaf.
- `max_depth`: Limits the depth of the trees.
  - **Tip**: Start with a range of 3-10, depending on your dataset’s complexity.
- `feature_fraction` the fraction of features used in each tree.
  - **Tip**: Start at 0.8 and decrease if you notice overfitting.
- `subsample` control the amount of data used for building each tree in your model.
  - Range: a fraction that ranges from 0 to 1, representing the proportion of the dataset to be randomly selected for training each tree (Recommend: 0.05 and 1)
  - By using only a subset of the data for each tree, the model can benefit from the diversity and reduce the correlation between the trees, which may help combat overfitting.
- `bagging_freq` is the frequency at which the data is sampled.
  - Rule of thumb: to set bagging_freq to a **positive** value or LightGBM will ignore `subsample`.
- `colsample_bytree` determines the proportion of features to be used for each tree.
  - Range: from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 means that all features will be considered for every tree
- `min_data_in_leaf` sets the minimum number of data points that must be present in a leaf node in each tree.
  - This parameter helps control the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting.
  - Range: 1 to 100
  - If you have a leaf node with only 1 data point, your prediction will be the value of that single data point.
  - If you have a leaf node with 30 data points, your prediction will be the average of those 30 data points.

    # Evaluate predictions
    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_val, y_pred_proba)
    roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)
    return roc_auc
